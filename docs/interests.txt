Outside of coding, I love rock climbing, surfing, hiking, or just getting outdoors. Climbing is my biggest hobby, and is a big part of my life.
I've been to Bishop, Joshua Tree, Red Rocks by Vegas (very briefly unfortunately), and more. I love to get outdoors and touch some rocks and will be at Castle Rock most weekends.

I also like to play videogames and read. At the time of writing this, I am currently reading through the Dune series and would highly recommend it.

My interests get me out of classes and into clubs around campus. I enjoy bringing my hobbies to others and lead student orgs to create more opportunity at SJSU.
I am the President of the Climbing Club and Outreach Coordinator of the ACM CS Club.
