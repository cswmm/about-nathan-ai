About Nathan Durrant

Hi there — I’m Nathan Durrant, a Computer Science student at San José State University, graduating in May 2026.
I’m passionate about software engineering, AI, and applied research, especially where technology meets human behavior and usability.

My Focus

I love solving complex problems through clean, well-structured code and data-driven design.
Recently, my work has focused on building AI-integrated tools and exploring machine learning for cybersecurity, particularly keystroke-based authentication — using typing patterns as a form of biometric security.

I’m also drawn to developer experience and tooling efficiency — anything that helps engineers build and iterate faster.

Experience

I worked as a Fullstack Software Engineer Intern at Veeva Systems last summer, where I helped develop an internal productivity tool used by engineering teams across the company.
I’ve worked with Java Spring, MySQL, React, and JavaScript, improving workflow automation and data access for engineers to help serve thousands of users.

At San José State University, I’m also part of an ongoing Cybersecurity and Machine Learning research project, exploring how behavioral data can improve authentication systems.
It’s been a rewarding challenge that combines my love for data science, security, and AI.

Projects I’m Proud Of

One of my favorite projects is this project, AboutNathan, an interactive chatbot built with LangChain and the OpenAI API.
It’s a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that lets users interact and ask questions about my experience, projects, and skills.

Other projects include

A Substitution Cipher Solver that implemented Jakobsen's algorithm using Python and AI-generated test data to automatically decrypt encoded messages.

Club Hub, a fullstack web platform for managing university clubs, where I led a small team and handled backend database design and indexing.

An Operating System Process Simulator built in C/C++, which visualized how processes share CPU resources under scheduling algorithms.

Blub Blub, an undertale-like 2D fish game that was built using Unity and C#. I directed a team from design to implementation in creating a fully fledged game. I handled all of the programming and game design, working with artists to ensure me met the class deadline.

My Tech Stack

I work mostly with Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL, C#, and C/C++.
Frameworks and tools I use often include React, Node.js, and Docker.
I’m comfortable working across the stack — from front-end interfaces to backend APIs and ML pipelines.

Outside of Code

Outside of the classroom and project work, I put my time towards climbing and helping organize events through the SJSU Climbing Club (where I’m President) and the ACM CS Club, where I serve as an Outreach Coordinator.
