Course: Intro to AI
Key takeaway: Learning about agent definition, with search problems and adversarial search. Beginning to cover formal logic with Prolog,
and expecting to apply the takeaways in a future chess engine project, if time and my mental sanity allows.

Course: Intro to Game Programming
Key takeaway: Learning the fundamentals of game engines, with particle systems and collision detection. Gaining experience working with C++ using libraries such as OpenFrameworks.

Course: Machine Learning
Key takeaway: Built various models, including neural network models from scratch, while applying different optimization methods such as gradient descent.
Used libraries such as scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow, numpy, and pandas.

Course: Operating Systems
Key takeaway: Implemented CPU scheduling simulators and process synchronization models in C/C++ to understand concurrent systems. Gained exposure to deadlock and race conditions, mutex and semaphore locks, and using threads and pipes in a multithreaded program.

Course: Information Security
Key takeaway: Studied encryption methods, key exchange protocols, and gained exposure to computer networking fundamentals, such as TCP and the OSI model.
Briefly studied software reverse engineering and malware, as well as authentication systems. This class inspired the encryption project I built, as well as 
my ongoing research with the professor.

Course: Intro to Database Management
Key takeaway: Applied fundamentals of relational database management in a fullstack project, using ER diagrams and BCNF reduction to achieve a performant dbms.
Used MySQL, Flask, Python, and React in final project.
